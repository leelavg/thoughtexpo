Welcome to my corner in the internet. My [Blog](/blog/) is where I document the things that I have learned over time and this website is an experimentation ground for my understanding around web technologies.

`leelavg`, the digital name I use is short for my full name, Leela Venkaiah G, here's a link to my resume in [HTML](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR7r29USQJFBpTjw7aNPwCorb7uv_7YdfJ0m2LFdVIoQ4FnAu1FfDH0CVyfqpj_ofMLAYZloT1vQ_QF/pub) and I currently work as a Software Quality Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) in Bengaluru, India.

I have a Bachelor's Degree from [RGUKT](https://rguktrkv.ac.in/) and I'm passionate about computers and all the magic that happens under the hood, particularly interested in NVMe, Persistent Memory Programming and Software Defined Storage among other things in Storage Technologies.

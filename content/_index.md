Welcome to my corner in the internet. My [Blog](/blog/) is where I document the things that I have learned over time and this website is an experimentation ground for my understanding around web technologies.

`leelavg`, the digital name I use is short for my full name, Leela Venkaiah G, here's a [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR7r29USQJFBpTjw7aNPwCorb7uv_7YdfJ0m2LFdVIoQ4FnAu1FfDH0CVyfqpj_ofMLAYZloT1vQ_QF/pub) to my resume and I currently work as a Software Quality Engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/) in Bengaluru, India.

I have a Bachelor's Degree from [RGUKT](https://rguktrkv.ac.in/) and I'm passionate about computers and all the magic that happens under the hood, particularly interested in NVMe, Persistent Memory Programming and Software Defined Storage among other things in Storage Technologies.

_Note: I'm not looking to monetize or run analytics on my blog and so please don't invest time in sending mails along those lines. No offense, I'm just sharing what I learnt/experimented._
